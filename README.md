# nrjavaserial
Old fork of the NRJavaSerial project (cf. https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial)

The purpose was to allow a dynamic handling of RS232 port (dis)connection in an OSGi environment. The directory observation work is made in the native code to avoid Java string processing limitations
